# Pokedex
In my class CSE2100 we were assigned a hw project to create a rendition of a Pokedex. This is my version of it in which I implemented a priority queue and used a bucket. There is a test class in which I had tested my programmning and algorithms to ensure correctiveness. I have not computed time complexity on this project.
